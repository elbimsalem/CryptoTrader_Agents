**Strategic Coordination Summary**

**1. Final Strategy Decisions (assets, allocations, timing)**

Based on the performance monitoring report, trade analysis, and risk metric status, I recommend maintaining the current portfolio allocation plan with the following adjustments:

* Reduce position size of SUIUSDT by 10% to maintain a well-diversified portfolio
* Adjust stop-loss levels to 5% below current price for all assets
* Monitor portfolio drawdown and adjust positions accordingly

The optimized portfolio allocation plan is designed to capture opportunities in the market while managing risk and maintaining a well-diversified portfolio. The plan includes the following asset allocations, entry strategies, and risk management controls:

* SOLUSDT: 25% of portfolio, $8,333
* SUIUSDT: 20% of portfolio, $6,667
* BTCUSDT: 15% of portfolio, $5,000
* ADAUSDT: 10% of portfolio, $3,333
* Entry strategies:
	+ ETHUSDT: Buy 50% of the position at market open, and the remaining 50% at market close
	+ SOLUSDT: Buy 75% of the position at market open, and the remaining 25% at market close
	+ SUIUSDT: Buy 100% of the position at market open
	+ BTCUSDT: Buy 50% of the position at market open, and the remaining 50% at market close
